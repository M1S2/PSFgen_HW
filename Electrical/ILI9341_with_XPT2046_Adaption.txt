The display is adapted to separate the XPT2046 and ILI9341 controller voltage levels.
Cut the voltage input line to the XPT2046 controller and connect it directly to the VCC input.

The following voltage levels can be used then:
T_IRQ		+5V
T_DO		+5V
T_DIN		+5V
T_CS		+5V
T_CLK		+5V
SDO(MISO)	+3V3
LED		+3V3
SCK		+3V3
SDI(MOSI)	+3V3
DC		+3V3
RESET		+3V3
CS		+3V3
GND		-
VCC		+5V
